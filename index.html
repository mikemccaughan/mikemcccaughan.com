            About Mike McCaughan

        <main>
            <p>Here's a brief overview of my life so far:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Born the 9<sup>th</sup> of March, 1973 in <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/">Honolulu</a>, <a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/">Hawai&#699;i</a>, the second child of Peter and Renda McCaughan (the first being <a title="David's Site" href="http://davidmccaughan.com/">David</a>).</li>
            <li>Moved five months later to <a href="http://www.cityofsanrafael.org/">San Rafael</a>, <a href="http://www.ca.gov/">California</a>. Spent the next 10 years there.</li>
            <li>Moved to <a href="http://www.wiltonct.org/">Wilton</a>, <a href="http://www.ct.gov/">Connecticut</a> in December of 1983. Saw <a href="http://nsidc.org/snow/">snow</a> for the first time.</li>
            <li>Graduated in 1991 from <a href="http://www.wiltonps.org/wilton-high-school">Wilton High School</a>.</li>
            <li>Enrolled in the <a href="http://engineering.umass.edu/">College of Engineering</a> of the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>.</li>
            <li>One semester later, left engineering for the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/theater/">Department of Theater</a> (phew).</li>
            <li>Two years later, moved back in with the parents, who had since moved to <a href="http://www.edenprairie.org/">Eden Prairie</a>, <a href="https://mn.gov/portal/">Minnesota</a>.</li>
            <li>While completing my Bachelor of Arts in <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/theatre">Theater</a> at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>, started work at <a href="http://www.regiscorp.com">Regis Corporation</a>.</li>
            <li>From 1994 to 2005, I worked in a variety of positions, culminating in Web Developer for the intranet. I built a couple of sites accessible outside their network, but they have since been redesigned.</li>
            <li>In 2005, I left Regis and started at <a href="http://www.rustconsulting.com/">Rust Consulting, Inc.</a>. I was a full-time employee, although my title was Technical Consultant. Don't ask me. I built a number of web sites, although none I'll link to, as they were for class action lawsuits and I really don't want to go there.</li>
            <li>August 20, 2007 brought my move to the true consulting world when I joined <a href="http://www.magenic.com/">Magenic Technologies</a>. I'm still a full-time employee, but I go out to clients, bill and all that good stuff. I consider it the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>On August 1, 2017 I transferred to the New York office of Magenic, continuing my tradition of making changes in my life every 10 years or so. I'm now living in <a href="https://www.stamfordct.gov/">Stamford</a>, <a href="http://www.ct.gov/">Connecticut</a>, a mere 15 miles from where I once lived.</li>
